"Reports To Go" is a simple iPhone app that embeds TouchBistro's [cloud reporting portal](https://cloud.touchbistro.com/) into a handy portable companion for accessing your restaurant's reports when you're on the go.

The app implements a simple web view and persists cookies across app states to streamline the log in process.
